## Logging in

You'll need to login first, you can do this through the `/login` endpoint for your respective client.

  <Card
    title="Student Login"
    icon={<School />}
    description="Authenticate with a student account"
    href="/student-api/login"
  />
  <Card
    title="Parent Login"
    icon={<House />}
    description="Authenticate with a parent account"
    href="/parent-api/login"
  />
</Cards>

With each request you must specify your authentication token in the `authorization` header, and optionally your student ID in the URL. However, it is **required** to specify student ID when using the parent API, as ClassCharts needs to know which student you would like to get data for.

E.g. `/apiv2student/activity/2339528` with the header: `Authorization: Basic eW91IHNob3VsZCBzdGFyIHRoaXMgcmVwbyE`.

## Retaining a session

To retain a session you need to ensure your `session_id` is always fresh. To do this, you'll need to call the `ping` endpoint with `include_data: "true"` for your respective client. In the request body there'll be a `meta.session_id` which can replace your old `session_id`.

    href="/student-api/ping"
  />
  <Card
    title="Parent Ping"
    description="Keep your parent session alive"
    href="/parent-api/ping"
  />
