  The `from` field does not work as you would expect, since this endpoint is
  meant for pagination on the home page, Classcharts only returns a 50 points
  from the `to` field.


  To get more points you will need to make use of the `last_id` field. Our
  [JavaScript Library](https://github.com/classchartsapi/classcharts-api-js)
  provides a `client.getFullActivity()` helper function to do this for you.
