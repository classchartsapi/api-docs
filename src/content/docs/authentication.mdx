description: Requirements for sending valid requests to ClassCharts.

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

You'll need to login first, you can do this through the `/login` endpoint for your respective client.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Student Login"
    href="/api-docs/student-client-api/operations/login"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Parent Login"
    href="/api-docs/parent-client-api/operations/login"
  />
</CardGrid>

With each request you must specify your authentication token in the `authorization` header, and optionally your student ID in the URL. However, it is **required** to spethecify student ID when using the parent API, as Classcharts needs to know which student you would like to get data for.

E.g. `https://www.classcharts.com/apiv2student/activity/2339528` with the header: `Authorization: Basic 5vf2v7n5uk9jftrxaarrik39vk6yjm48`.

<Aside>
  Ensure you refresh this token every 180 seconds. This can be done through the
  `/ping` endpoint for your respective client.
