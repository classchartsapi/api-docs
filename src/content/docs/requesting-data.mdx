title: Requesting Data
description: Requirements for sending valid requests to ClassCharts.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

With each request you must specify your authentication token in the `authorization` header, and optionally your student ID in the URL. However, it is **required** to specify the student ID when using the parent API, as Classcharts needs to know which student you would like to get data for.

E.g. `https://www.classcharts.com/apiv2student/activity/2339528` with the header: `Authorization: Basic 5vf2v7n5uk9jftrxaarrik39vk6yjm48`.

<Aside>Ensure you refresh this token every 180 seconds.</Aside>
